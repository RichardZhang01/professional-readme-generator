## Description
- My motivation behind this projects was to utilize Node.js and some of the libraries such as Inquirer and fs to be able to create an application capable of capturing and utilizing user inputs.
- I built this project to enhance my understanding of how Node.js works, how different libraries are linked together, and some of the things we can do with the back-end of the fullstack development process.
- This project aims to create a way to more easily generate README files.
- I learned how to use Node.js, how to initialize and install packages through npm, and how to link together different libraries. I also learned more about functions and JavaScript.
